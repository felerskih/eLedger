To build the command line interface project, open the eLedger.sln in Visual Studio 2017 or 2019. You will need to make sure you have .netcore 2.1 installed and verify that your eLedger project is using it. Make sure the Solution startup project is set to eLedger. Then build and run the application as you would normally. Supported commands will be listed as you go.

The GUI has no implemented functionality currently, but can be ran from "eLedgerGui/obj/Debug/eLedgerGUI.exe".
